libjhgdc - Java library client for HGD
======================================

libjhgdc is a Java library client for the HGD (Hackaton Gunther Daemon).

It can be used for implementing Java clients for the HGD.


Prerequisites
-------------

To build, you will need:

  * Java SE 6
  * JUnit 4.5 - JUnit is used for conducting unit tests, and is not 
                needed to run the library itself.

Building
--------

The building system is based on Ant.

The default target builds the jar file, and the API documentation.
Available targets:
 * compile
 * jar
 * javadoc

Documentation
-------------

The generated API documentation is saved in doc/api/.

The unit tests assume the existence of a HGD network daemon running on 
localhost.
